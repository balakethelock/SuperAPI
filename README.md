This fork contains a spell linking bugfix exclusive to the Turtle WoW custom vanilla+ server.

### Addon to allow compability between the mod and vanilla default interface. Also adds a minimap icon to change some mod settings. It is recommended for addon makers to read this to get a gist of some of the mod's features

### Settings
Right click the minimap icon to choose persistent options for:
- Autoloot
- Clickthrough
- GUID in combat log/events
- FoV
- Background Sound
- Uncapped Sounds
- Targetting circle style

**NOTE: If using Vanilla Tweaks quickloot all of the Autoloot options will be reversed (always on will actually be always off, Shift to toggle on will be Shift to toggle off etc).**

### Other features
- Adds "mouseover" support to all default blizzard unitframes
- Shows item charges in bag
- Allows Shift clicking a spell in your spellbook to link it to chat
- Adds chat command to toggle showing unit names or GUIDs in combat log
  
## Modules:
